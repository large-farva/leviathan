# Leviathan
**Leviathan** is a custom [Fedora Atomic](https://fedoraproject.org/atomic-desktops/) image built for personal use by my wife and I â€” optimized for **gaming**, **daily use**, and tailored **GNOME enhancements**.

This image is most likely not for many folks.

## Base System
- Built on Fedora 42
- Image built on **[Bazzite](https://bazzite.gg/)** (NVIDIA variant)
- GNOME 48
- Built using [uBlue's image-template](https://github.com/ublue-os/image-template)

## Features
- Custom GNOME layout
- Custom Theming
- Pruned wallpapers, Flatpaks, RPM/DNF, and Gnome Extensions
- Modular build scripts for easy tweaks

## Installation Methods

### Bootc "Container" Install
On any rpm-ostree host (Fedora Silverblue, Bazzite, etc.)

Install directly via `bootc`:

```bash
sudo bootc switch --enforce-container-sigpolicy ghcr.io/large-farva/leviathan:latest
```
This swaps your OS in-place to the Leviathan container image.

### ISO Installer

**Update:** The ISO sucks. \
It would get stuck on a grey screen upon installation, after the Anaconda installation selections. I tried to fix it, but it's just failing now. \
Just install Bazzite and rebase if you want to try it out.

Burn or boot from the [Leviathan ISO](https://github.com/large-farva/leviathan/actions/workflows/build_iso.yml) (see artifacts in workflow runs):
- Fully graphical Anaconda installer
- Custom ```iso.toml``` with support for:
    - Disk and user setup
    - Localization and timezone

## Modularity & Customizations
