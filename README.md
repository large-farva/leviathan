# Leviathan
**Leviathan** is a custom [Fedora Atomic](https://fedoraproject.org/atomic-desktops/) image built for personal use by my wife and I â€” optimized for **gaming**, **daily use**, and tailored **GNOME enhancements**.

This image is most likely not for many folks.

## Base System
- Built on Fedora 42
- Image built on **[Bazzite](https://bazzite.gg/)** (NVIDIA variant)
- GNOME 48
- Built using [uBlue's image-template](https://github.com/ublue-os/image-template)

## Features
- Custom GNOME layout
- Pruned Flatpak, RPM, and Gnome Extension bloat

## Installation Methods

### Bootc Install (On an existing system)
Install directly via `bootc`:

```bash
sudo bootc switch --enforce-container-sigpolicy ghcr.io/large-farva/leviathan:latest
```

### ISO Installer

Update: The ISO sucks.

Burn or boot from the [Leviathan ISO](https://github.com/large-farva/leviathan/actions/workflows/build_iso.yml) (see artifacts in workflow runs):
- Fully graphical Anaconda installer
- Custom ```iso.toml``` with support for:
    - Disk and user setup
    - Localization and timezone

Powered by [bootc-image-builder](https://github.com/containers/bootc-image-builder) for portable and reproducible installs.
